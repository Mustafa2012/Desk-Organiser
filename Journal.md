## August 26th: Made the main Frame!!

I made the main frame and added little platform thingies for my two watches. I didn't know how to make two parts join so I had to do a lot of experimenting and eventually found it by accident.

## August 27th: Added headphone stand!

I added a headphone stand for my soundcore headphones! This was pretty easy except for the dimensions.

**Total time spent:40 minutes**

## August 27th: Almost completed it!!

Imma be honest, I did not think I could do this in this much time. I had to change the size of the mail holder multiple times and had to also change the size of the main frame from 390ish mm to 500 mm. I added a little place where my cmf buds could sit. I also made a little snack box! . I am happy with the current design but I might add a glasses holder. Tomorrow

## August 28th: Completed it!!!!!!

I just finished polishing my design like rounding off the sharp edges. I also added a holder for my eye glasses. I think the organiser look very cool considering this is my biggest projects yet!
